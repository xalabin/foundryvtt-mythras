# Mythras

A rudimentary implementation of __Mythras__ for Foundry VTT, based entirely on the Simple Worldbuilding System for Foundry designed by Atropos.

**The Design Mechanism** produces and publishes the __Mythras__ roleplaying game, the acclaimed and innovative percentile system. __Mythras__ is supported by an extensive range of supplements and adventures, featuring everything from Sword & Sorcery to Science Fiction and Urban Fantasy Horror.

__Mythras__ is the new name for an older game, but while the name might have changed, the system remains the same, but presented in an updated format with new interior artwork and layout design, along with some new content (Special Effects, small tweaks to the rules, and Spirit Combat Effects). In fact, we've managed to pack more into a smaller space, and reduced the price accordingly.

For those new to the game, __Mythras__ is a percentile system. In __Mythras__ your characters are defined by their culture, career, community, background, comrades, skills, magic and cults. Progression is through skill advancement – not levels or similarly abstract concepts. As your characters adventure and quest, their capabilities improve and their relationships deepen and strengthen. Players and Games Masters have complete flexibility over what can be achieved, and the way characters develop is entirely dependent on choices players make, depending on their characters’ aspirations and motivations.

Games Masters receive a huge amount of support through the Mythras rules. All the concepts and game mechanics are explained clearly with options and considerations explored and presented for ease of use. You need only this rulebook for many years of exciting and imaginative play.
